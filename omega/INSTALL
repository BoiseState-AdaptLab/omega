BUILD
=====

1. Edit Makefile.config. Change BUILD_CODEGEN to false if you don't want
   CodeGen+ library to be built.  SUIF support in CodeGen+ will be
   automatically built if SUIFHOME environment variable is set.

2. Do "make depend".

3. Optionally, do "make clean" to remove object files or "make veryclean"
   to additionally remove target files.

4. Do "make".


INSTALLATION
============

You can use Omega+ and CodeGen+ in source directory since all links
are already created in bin/, lib/ and include/ subdirectories.

omega/            source directory root
  bin/            command line interface "oc"
  lib/            libraries "libomega.a" and "libcode_gen.a"
  include/
    omega.h       main Omega+ header file
    omega/        Omega+ header files
    basic/        basic utility header files
    code_gen/     CodeGen+ header files

You can also do "make install" to copy necessary files into
/usr/local for root account, or use home directory for other accounts.
